# FirstSpeciesCtpt
Generating First Species Counterpoint using Neural Networks and Magenta.js/Tensorflow.js

Using the magenta.js and tensorflow.js software, this project aims to train a neural network created in Python to generate First Species counterpoint in the style of Fux based on the input of a cantus firmus using completed MIDI counterpoints.
